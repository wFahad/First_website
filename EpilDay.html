            <h1>Purple Day</h1>

            <h3>Purple Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Cassidy Megan created the idea of Purple Day in 2008, motivated by her own struggles with epilepsy. Cassidy's goal is to get people talking about epilepsy in an effort to dispel myths and inform those with seizures that they are not alone. The Epilepsy Association of Nova Scotia came on board in 2008 to help develop Cassidy's idea which is now known as the Purple Day for epilepsy campaign</p><br>

            <h3>Epilepsy Association of Nova Scotia and The Anita Kaufmann Foundation</h3>
            <p>In 2009, the New York-based Anita Kaufmann Foundation and Epilepsy Association of Nova Scotia joined forces to launch Purple Day internationally. As the global sponsors of Purple Day, both organizations are committed to partnering with individuals and organizations around the world to promote epilepsy awareness.<br>

            The combined efforts of AKF and EANS have lead to the involvement of numerous organizations, schools, businesses, politicians and celebrities around the word. On March 26, 2009, over 100,000 students, 95 workplaces and 116 politicians participated in Purple Day. The principal sponsors also developed marketing and media materials available for download free of charge.<br>
