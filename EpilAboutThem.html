                <h2> What is epilepsy? Will I have seizures forever?</h2>
                <p>You may have a lot of questions about epilepsy. We will help you understand the basics,
                answer the most common questions, and help you find resources and other information you may need.
                However, information alone won’t help you manage your epilepsy and find a way to cope with the effects on your daily life. 
                You’ll need to learn how to use the information and make it work for you.</p><br>

                <h2> What Is Epilepsy?</h2>
                <p>Epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects the nervous system.
                Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder.
                It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures 
                (or after one seizure with a high risk for more) that were not caused by some known medical condition.</p><br>

                <h2>What Are Seizures?</h2>
                <p>Seizures seen in epilepsy are caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the brain.
                The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown…</p><br>
